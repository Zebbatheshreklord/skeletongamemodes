#summary Team Skeleton base gamemode

= Introduction =

I make a gamemode base for people new in lua that want to make a gamemode for their own server and they do not have the skills to make one.

= Details =

I make this file based on the skeleton by garry. I noticed that there is a gamemode base by rambo, however it is different because is the gamemode more easy to customize that you can be experienced.

I feel free to use any new file in the gamemode with the property credits for the autor in the code. Then i just need some feedback from some issues thant i do not know how to solve. This is the Team Skeleton Gamemode that i make using the program notepad++
